Preserve and restore editor scroll positions in the WordPress admin area after page refresh events.

== Description ==
Want to help reduce the need for excessive scrolling in the WordPress admin area?

Does it drive you nuts every time you reload/refresh/save a page or post that you are back at the top of the page instead of where you made that last edit?

If so, then this plugin can help restore a little of that lost sanity.

It saves and then sestores scrollbar positions to any area in the admin panel after a page refresh event. Saved scroll positions last for your entire session, until you sign out or restart your browser.
